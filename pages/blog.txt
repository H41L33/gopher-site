i# Blog		localhost	70
iA link directory to all my posts, available to view as page, download as plaintext or markdown. Each post is a copy of boilerplate HTML like the rest of this website, and has been written directly into HTML.		localhost	70
iI have my own scripts to convert my content between HTML, Markdown, and TXT (now powered by [Slate](https://github.com/H41L33/slate) ✨).		localhost	70
iAll the content is loaded immediately, no infinite scrolling, and all my posts are available to view as a page, or download in TXT and MD formats.		localhost	70
